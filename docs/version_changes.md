FloPy Changes
-----------------------------------------------

### Version 3.2.7 pre-release

* Added support for retrieving time series from binary cell-by-cell files. Cell-by-cell time series are accessed in the same way they are accessed for heads and concentrations but a text string is required.
* Added support for FORTRAN free format array data using n*value where n is the number of times value is repeated.
* Added support for comma separators in 1D data in LPF and UPF files
* Added support for comma separators on non array data lines in DIS, BCF, LPF, UPW, HFB, and RCH Packages.
* Added `reset_budgetunit()` method to OC package to faciltate saving cell-by-cell binary output to a single file for all packages that can save cell-by-cell output.
* Added a `get_residual` method to the `CellBudgetFile` class.
* Added support for binary stress period files (`OPEN/CLOSE filename (BINARY)`) in `wel` stress packages on load and instantiation. Will extend to other list-based MODFLOW stress packages.
* Added a new `flopy.utils.HeadUFile` Class (located in binaryfile.py) for reading unstructured head files from MODFLOW-USG.  The `get_data()` method for this class returns a list of one-dimensional head arrays for each layer.
* Bug fixes:
    1. Fixed bug in OC when printing and saving data for select stress periods and timesteps. In previous versions, OC data was repeated until respecified.
    2. Fixed bug in SUB if data set 15 is passed to preserved unit numbers (i.e., use unit numbers passed on load).
    3. Fixed bugs in SUB and SUBWT load to pop original unit number.
    4. Fixed bug in MT3D BTN obs.
    5. Fixed bug in LPF regarding when HANI is read and written.

### Version 3.2.6
* Added functionality to read binary grd file for unstructured grids.
* Additions to SpatialReference class:
	* xll, yll input option
	* transform method to convert model coordinates to real-world coordinates
	* epsg and length_multiplier arguments
* Export:
	* Added writing of prj files to shapefile export; prj information can be passed through spatial reference class, or given as an EPSG code or existing prj file path
	* Added NetCDF export to MNW2
* Added MODFLOW support for:
    * FHB Package - no support for flow or head auxiliary variables (datasets 2, 3, 6, and 8)
    * HOB Package
* New utilities:
	* `flopy.utils.get_transmissivities()` Computes transmissivity in each model layer at specified locations and open intervals. A saturated thickness is determined for each row, column or x, y location supplied, based on the well open interval (sctop, scbot), if supplied, otherwise the layer tops and bottoms
    and the water table are used.
* Added MODFLOW-LGR support - no support for model name files in different directories than the directory with the lgr control file.
* Additions to MODPATH:
	* shapefile export of MODPATH Pathline and Endpoint data
	* Modpath.create_mpsim() supports MNW2
	* creation of MODPATH StartingLocations files
	* Easy subsetting of endpoint and pathline results to destination cells of interest  
* New ZoneBudget class provides ZONEBUDGET functionality:
    * reads a CellBudgetFile and accumulates flows by zone
    * pass `kstpkper` or `totim` keyword arguments to retrieve a subset of available times in the CellBudgetFile
    * includes a method to write the budget recarrays to a .csv file
    * ZoneBudget objects support numerical operators to facilitate conversion of units
    * utilities are included which read/write ZONEBUDGET-style zone files to and from numpy arrays
    * pass a dictionary of {zone: "alias"} to rename fields to more descriptive names (e.g. {1: 'New York', 2: 'Delmarva'}
* Added new precision='auto' option to flopy.utils.binaryfile for HeadFile and UcnFile readers.  This will automatically try and determine the float precision for head files created by single and double precision versions of MODFLOW.  'auto' is now the default.  Not implemented yet for cell by cell flow file.
* Modified MT3D-related packages to also support MT3D-USGS
  * BTN will support the use of keywords (e.g., 'MODFLOWStyleArrays', etc.) on the first line
  * DSP will support the use of keyword NOCROSS
  * Keyword FREE now added to MT3D name file when the flow-transport link (FTL) file is formatted.  Previously defaulted to unformatted only.
* Added 3 new packages:
  * SFT: Streamflow Transport, companion transport package for use with the SFR2 package in MODFLOW
  * LKT: Lake Transport, companion transport package for use with the LAK3 package in MODFLOW
  * UZT: Unsaturated-zone Transport, companion transport package for use with the UZF1 package in MODFLOW
* Modified LMT
  * load() functionality will now support optional PACKAGE_FLOWS line (last line of LMT input)
  * write_file() will will now insert PACKAGE_FLOWS line based on user input

* Bug fixes:
  1. Fixed bug in parsenamefile when file path in namefile is surrounded with quotes.
  2. Fixed bug in check routine when THICKSTRT is specified as an option in the LPF and UPW packages.
  3. Fixed bug in BinaryHeader.set_values method that prevented setting of entries based on passed kwargs.
  4. Fixed bugs in reading and writing SEAWAT Viscosity package.
  5. The DENSE and VISC arrays are now Transient3d objects, so they may change by stress period.
  6. MNW2: fixed bug with k, i, j node input option and issues with loading at model level
  7. Fixed bug in ModflowDis.get_cell_volumes().


### Version 3.2.5

* Added support for MNW2 package. Load and write of .mnw2 package files supported. Support for .mnwi, or the results files (.qsu, .byn) not yet implemented.
* Improved support for changing the output format of arrays and variables written to MODFLOW input files. 
* Restructued SEAWAT support so that packages can be added directly to the SEAWAT model, in addition to the approach of adding a modflow model and a mt3d model.  Can now load a SEAWAT model.
* Added load support for MT3DMS Reactions package
* Added multi-species support for MT3DMS Reactions package
* Added static method to Mt3dms().load_mas that reads an MT3D mass file and returns a recarray
* Added static method to Mt3dms().load_obs that reads an MT3D mass file and returns a recarray
* Added method to flopy.modpath.Modpath to create modpath simulation file from modflow model instance boundary conditions. Also added examples of creating modpath files and post-processing modpath pathline and endpoint files to the flopy3_MapExample notebook.

* Bug fixes:
  1. Fixed issue with VK parameters for LPF and UPW packages.
  2. Fixed issue with MT3D ADV load in cases where empty fields were present in the first line of the file.
  3. Fixed cross-section array plotting issues.
  4. BTN observation locations must now be entered in zero-based indices (a 1 is now added to the index values written to btn file)
  5. Uploaded supporting files for SFR example notebook; fixed issue with segment_data submitted as array (instead of dict) and as 0d array(s).
  6. Fixed CHD Package so that it now supports options, and therefore, auxiliary variables can be specified.
  7. Fixed loading BTN save times when numbers are touching. 

### Version 3.2.4
* Added basic model checking functionality (`.check()`).

* Added support for reading SWR Process observation, stage, budget, flow, reach-aquifer exchanges, and structure flows.

* `flopy.utils.HydmodObs` returns a numpy recarray. Previously numpy arrays were returned except when the `slurp()` method was used. The slurp method has been deprecated but the same functionality is available using the `get_data()` method. The recarray returned from the `get_data()` method includes the `totim` value and one or all of the observations (`HYDLBL`).

* Added support for MODFLOW-USG DISU package for unstructured grids.

* Added class (`Gridgen`) for creating layered quadtree grids using GRIDGEN (`flopy.utils.gridgen`). See the flopy3_gridgen notebook for an example of how to use the `Gridgen` class.

* Added user-specified control on use of `OPEN/CLOSE` array options (see flopy3_external_file_handling notebook).

* Added user-specified control for array output formats (see flopy3_array_outputformat_options IPython notebook).

* Added shapefile as optional output format to `.export()` method and deprecated `.to_shapefile()` method.

* Bug fixes:
  1. Fixed issue with right justified format statement for array control record for MT3DMS.
  2. Fixed bug writing PHIRAMP for MODFLOW-NWT well files.
  3. Fixed bugs in NETCDF export methods.
  4. Fixed bugs in LMT and BTN classes.

### Version 3.2.3
* Added template creation support for several packages for used with PEST (and UCODE).
 
* Added support for the SEAWAT viscosity (VSC) package.

* Added support for the MODFLOW Stream (STR), Streamflow-Routing (SFR2), Subsidence (SUB), and Subsidence and Aquifer-System Compaction Package for Water-Table Aquifers (SWT) Packages.

* Mt3d model was redesigned based on recent changes to the Modflow model.  Mt3d packages rewritten to support multi-species.  Primary packages can be loaded (btn, adv, dsp, ssm, gcg).  Array utilities modified to read some MT3D RARRAY formats.

* Fixed array loading functionality for case when the CNSTNT value is zero.  If CNSTNT is zero and is used as an array multiplier, it is changed to 1 (as done in MODFLOW).

* Added support for the MODFLOW HYDMOD (HYD) Package and reading binary files created by the HYDMOD Package (`HydmodObs` Class) in the `flopy.utils` submodule.

* `flopy.utils.CellBudgetFile` returns a numpy recarray for list based budget data. Previously a dictionary with the `node` number and `q` were returned. The recarray will return the `node` number, `q`, and the `aux` variables for list based budget data.

* Added travis-ci automated testing.

### Version 3.2.2
* FloPy now supports some simple plotting capabilities for two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes  and transient two-dimensional stress period input data using the `.plot()` methods associated with the data array classes (`util_2d`, `util_3d`, and `transient_2d`). The model results reader classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) have also been extended to include a `.plot()` method that can be used to create simple plots of model output data. See the notebook [flopy3_PlotArrayExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_PlotArrayExample.ipynb).

* Added `.to_shapefile()` method to two- and three-dimensional model input data array classes (`util_2d` and `util_3d`), transient two-dimensional stress period input data classes (`transient_2d`), and model output data classes (`HeadFile`, `UcnFile`, and `CellBudgetFile`) that allows model data to be exported as polygon shapefiles with separate attribute columns for each model layer.

* Added support for ASCII model results files.

* Added support for reading MODPATH version 6 pathline and endpoint output files and plotting MODPATH results using mapping capabilities in `flopy.plot` submodule.

* Added `load()` method for MODFLOW GMG solver.

* Bug fixes:
  1. Multiplier in array control record was not being applied to arrays
  2. vani parameter was not supported

### Version 3.2.1
* FloPy can now be used with **Python 3.x**

* Revised setters for package class variables stored using the `util_2d` or `util_3d` classes.

* Added option to load a subset of MODFLOW packages in a MODFLOW model name file using `load_only=` keyword.

### Version 3.1
* FloPy now supports some simple mapping and cross-section capabilities through the `flopy.plot` submodule. See the notebook [flopy3_MapExample](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_MapExample.ipynb).

* Full support for all Output Control (OC) options including DDREFERENCE, SAVE IBOUND, and layer lists. All Output Control Input is specified using words. Output Control Input using numeric codes is still available in the ModflowOc88 class. The ModflowOc88 class is currently deprecated and no longer actively maintained.

* Added support for standard MULT package FUNCTION and EXPRESSION functionality are supported. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods. 

### Version 3.0

FloPy is significantly different from earlier versions of FloPy (previously hosted on [googlecode](https://code.google.com/p/flopy/)). The main changes are:

* FloPy is fully zero-based. This means that layers, rows and columns start counting at *zero*. The reason for this is consistency. Arrays are zero-based by default in Python, so it was confusing to have a mix.

* Input for packages that take *layer, row, column, data* input (like the wel or ghb package) has changed and is much more flexible now. See the notebook [flopy3boundaries](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3boundaries.ipynb)

* Input for the MT3DMS Source/Sink Mixing (SSM) Package has been modified to be consistent with the new MODFLOW boundary package input and is more flexible than previous versions of FloPy. See the notebook [flopy3ssm](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy/blob/master/examples/Notebooks/flopy3_multi-component_SSM.ipynb)

* Support for use of EXTERNAL and OPEN/CLOSE array specifiers has been improved.

* *load()* methods have been developed for all of the standard MODFLOW packages and a few less used packages (*e.g.* SWI2).

* MODFLOW parameter support has been added to the `load()` methods. MULT, PVAL, and ZONE packages are now supported and parameter data are converted to arrays in the `load()` methods. MODFLOW parameters are not supported in `write()` methods.
